## Installation and Setup

### Prerequisites

- Raspberry Pi or Arduino for the main controller.
- Motors, sensors, and other hardware components.
- A computer or smartphone for web interface control.

### Software Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/agricultural-rover.git
    cd agricultural-rover
    ```

2. **Install necessary dependencies**:
    For Raspberry Pi:
    ```sh
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install python3-pip
    pip3 install -r requirements.txt
    ```

    For Arduino:
    - Follow the instructions to install the Arduino IDE and required libraries.

3. **Upload code to the microcontroller**:
    - For Raspberry Pi, run the main script:
      ```sh
      python3 main.py
      ```
    - For Arduino, upload the provided Arduino sketches using the Arduino IDE.

### Hardware Setup

1. **Assemble the tracked chassis**:
    - Follow the step-by-step instructions provided in `assembly_instructions.md` to assemble the chassis, attach the motors, and connect the sensors.

2. **Connect the microcontroller**:
    - Connect the Raspberry Pi or Arduino to the motors and sensors as described in the `hardware_connections.md` file.

3. **Power the system**:
    - Connect the power supply to the microcontroller and ensure all components are properly powered.

## Usage

1. **Start the web interface**:
    - Open a terminal and run the web server script:
      ```sh
      python3 web_interface.py
      ```

2. **Access the web interface**:
    - Open a web browser on your computer or smartphone and navigate to `http://<raspberry_pi_ip_address>:5000`.

3. **Control the robot**:
    - Use the web interface to navigate the robot, select tasks, and monitor its status.
